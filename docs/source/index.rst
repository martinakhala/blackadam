Dwayne Johnson's highly anticipated superhero debut as Black Adam is nearly here. It's the realization of casting rumors that date as far back as 2007, and according to Johnson, the beginning of "a new era in the DC universe." Though our Black Adam review doesn't quite agree with that sentiment.

Black Adam is one of the biggest DCEU films in a long time, so when will Black Adam release on HBO Max? Black Adam follows the titular anti-hero as portrayed by Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, with DC apparently planning to reinvent their cinematic universe around the massive movie star. DC has put a massive marketing push behind the film, with Warner Bros. Discovery's 2022 plan completely relying on the film's success. Many viewers are excited to see Black Adam on the big screen, but others may choose to wait for its release on HBO Max.

Black Adam is finally hitting screens this week â€“ ahead of Dwayne Johnsonâ€™s DC debut, hereâ€™s the movieâ€™s release date, how you can watch it, and whether itâ€™s available to stream on HBO Max or another platform.

Black Adam release date and where to watch it

Black Adam is due for release today, October 21, in the UK and US â€“ and it will be exclusively available to watch in cinemas.

Black Adam is showing in all major cinemas, so you can check your local theater for showtimes.

Where to Watch Black Adam Online Free?
Originally, Black Adam was only scheduled to be released digitally on the streaming service HBO Max. However, thanks to positive reactions following test screenings, the studio decided to bless us all by giving the action movie a theatrical release instead.

Thatâ€™s right, cinephiles, it is time to get your popcorn buckets ready because Black Adam is coming to your local cineplex. Black Adam will hit UK and US cinemas come October 21, 2022.

Is Black Adam on streaming?

Black Adam wonâ€™t be available to stream on the day of release. While many of Warner Brosâ€™ 2021 movies were added to HBO Max on the same day as they hit cinemas, like The Suicide Squad and Dune, Black Adam will not be released on the platform straight away.

This is a result of the Warner Bros. Discovery merger, which has scrapped the strategy that saw movies get a 45-day theatrical window before being added to HBO Max.

Is Black Adam Available on HBO Max?
Sadly, Black Adam will not be coming to HBO Max on Oct. 21 when the film opens in theaters, so if youâ€™re attempting to find the film on HBO Max allow us to save you some time as you wonâ€™t find Black Adam in the HBO Max catalog â€” at least not at the present moment. The new DC Comics film will open exclusively in theaters which means fans hoping to see the movie will need to head to their local theaters to see the film during its initial run.

The good news is that the film will make its way to HBO Max eventually, but an exact release date has not been set and Warner Bros. Discovery is likely to make fans wait at least 45-60 days before the film begins streaming. Warner Bros. Discovery is looking to put a bigger focus on theatrical releases and video-on-demand windows before a film streams on HBO Max.

Is Black Adam Available On Netflix?
No, Black Adam is not on Netflix â€” and it likely wonâ€™t be any time soon seeing as it is going to stream on HBO Max. In the meantime, youâ€™ll just have to head out to a theater or wait for it to become available on streaming and VOD.

Is Black Adam Available On Hulu?
Hulu is a streaming service that offers Black Adam for viewing. You can watch Black Adam on Hulu if youâ€™re already a member. If you donâ€™t want to subscribe, you may join for a one-month free trial and then cancel before the month ends if you donâ€™t wish to continue the membership. Black Adam may be available for rental or purchase on other streaming services.
